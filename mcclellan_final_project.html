			<h2> Abortion on a global scale: why is accurate data so hard to find?</h2>
			<h4> Unintended pregnancy rates are highest in countries that restrict abortion access and lowest in countries where abortion is broadly legal. </h4>
			<h5>By Katie McClellan</h5>

			<p>Abortion data is hard to find and even harder to accurately collect, according to The 19th News data journalist Jasmine Mithani.</p>
			<p>This data was compiled by the World Health Organization using data they collected in their Global Abortion Policies Database, which breaks down different facets of abortion law and access by country where data is available.</p>

			<h3>Why is it so hard to find accurate abortion data?</h3>

			<p>Finding comprehensive abortion data is nearly impossible, Mithani said. Not every country or state collects this data and in some countries criminal codes prevent women from reporting, not to mention general stigma around abortion. Women also go outside of official channels to receive abortion services and care and travel across state and country lines, which skews the data.</p>
			<p>“I wonder how many abortions were not counted before because they were self managed, because people couldn't go to a clinic, because they saw doctors out of state or because they received treatment in channels that would not be accounted for in these type of reports,” Mithani said.</p>
			<p>Not all states provide abortion data Mithani said, for example California, a state with a large population where many abortions take place, does not. This also happens on a global scale, some countries like Venezuela, Mexico and The United Kingdom do not provide national abortion data. Mithani said sometimes this is due to privacy reasons.</p>
			<p>“I think especially now privacy is such a concern that there's always stigma when people are asked about abortion and about their personal experiences with abortion,” Mithani said. “It's something that you always have to contend with, that you're asking people questions about something they might not want to answer so they might not be truthful, and that happens more often with abortion.”</p>

			<p>The WHO data indicates that 42 countries included in their global abortion policy database have abortion specific laws. 19.23% of countries included in the dataset have an abortion law and only 10.84% have a reproductive health act. Reproductive health acts, though they vary widely by country, generally enshrine the right to maternal healthcare, prenatal services, safe childbirth, access to contraception and access to legal and safe abortion. This indicates that countries may care more about specific abortion laws, whether protections or restrictions, than overall reproductive health services.</p>
			<p>“I think that's definitely something we see in the United States,” Mithani said. “When I think of reproductive care, I definitely think also about support systems for new parents and also policies that help children are kind of like the natural things afterward. There certainly is more of a focus on restricting abortion than on creating family friendly policies. I think that comes down to what people are motivated by.”</p>

			<h3>Comparing the United States with other countries</h3>
			<p>“I think speaking in the U.S. context there's a lot of this rhetoric on abortion restriction that is extremely religious in nature and specifically Christian in nature… and depending on how Christian the leaders of a nation are and how high up abortion ranks on their priorities,” Mithani said.</p>
			<p>Andorra, El Salvador and the Philippines are <a href="https://time.com/6173229/countries-abortion-illegal-restrictions/">examples</a> of mostly Catholic countries where abortion is completely prohibited. In contrast, Argentina, a primarily Roman Catholic country, legalized abortion up to 14 weeks in 2021.</p>
			<p>While the Society for Family Planning data indicates that reported abortions have increased in the United States since Dobbs v Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization, Guttmacher data shows that the abortion rate in Europe has declined 64% in the past 30 years.</p>
			<p>Since 2000, 37 countries have changed their abortion laws, expanding the legal grounds on which women can access abortion services, according to Public Broadcasting Service.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<h2>In the last several years, some countries have expanded abortion access</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Mexico decriminalized abortion in 2023</li>
					<li>Argentina legalized abortion in 2021</li>

				<h2>Category explanation</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> <b>Reproductive health acts</b>, though they vary widely by country, generally enshrine the right to maternal healthcare, prenatal services, safe childbirth, access to contraception and access to legal and safe abortion.</li>
					<li> <b>Abortion specific laws</b> include regulations and policies related to facilities/settings where abortion can be provided.</li>
					<li> <b>Laws on medical practitioners</b> refer to regulations and policies related to health-care personnel permitted to provide abortion, additional requirements to provide induced abortion services and post-abortion care.</li>
					<li> <b>Criminal codes</b> refer to who can be criminally charged for accessing, providing or helping someone access abortion services.</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Given the overturn of the United States’ abortion access protected in Roe v Wade, the country has fallen behind in comparison to countries like <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/European-abortion-law-a-comparative-review.pdf">Latvia</a> in protecting women’s health care. Between 1990–1994 and 2015–2019 the abortion rate in Latvia declined 82%. In Latvia abortion is legal upon request up to 22 weeks.</p>
			<p>In <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/?country=CAN">Canada,</a> abortion is legal upon request without a gestational limit. In <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/?country=ARG">Argentina,</a> abortion is legal up to 14 weeks. Much like the U.S. <a href="https://reproductiverights.org/maps/worlds-abortion-laws/?country=AUS">Australia</a> regulates abortion at the state level on request.</p>
			<p>Abortion in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/06/14/japan-abortion-pill-women-reproductive-rights/">Japan </a> is allowed under a term limit of 22 weeks for endangerment to the health of the pregnant woman, economic hardship, or rape, however the law requires spousal consent.</p>
			<div class="list">
				<h2>Only four countries have rolled back the legality of abortion since 1993 </h2>
				<ul>
					<li>United States- 2022 discretion at state level</li>
					<li>Nicaragua- 2006</li>
					<li>El Salvador- 1998</li>
					<li>Poland- 1993</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Further understanding</h3>
			<p>The Guttmacher Institute’s <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide">data </a> shows that the rates of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion in low income countries, at 40%, are actually closer to high income countries, at 43%, than to middle income countries which have the highest rate of abortions at 66%. This indicates that access to abortion is not necessarily indicative of having money. However, in some countries like the U.S. women travel to different states to recieve abortion care, and have to spend money on a hotel room, potentially childcare, food and more.</p>
			<p>According to Guttmacher, unintended pregnancy <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-worldwide">rates </a> are highest in countries that restrict abortion access and lowest in countries where abortion is broadly legal. Their data showed that in countries that restrict abortion, the percentage of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion has increased during the past 30 years, from 36% in 1990–1994 to 50% in 2015–2019.</p>
			<p>“Despite all of these policies, the number of abortion procedures that have happened in the United States that have happened in a clinical environment has gone up over the past year,” Mithani said. “Just because the number has gone up doesn't mean that access hasn't been severely restricted in many parts of the United States in the past year.”</p>
			<p>In 2021 Texas passed SB 8, a five-week abortion ban, which allows private citizens to sue anyone they suspect of providing or facilitating an abortion. Mithani said that other states like <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-the-u-s-compares-with-the-rest-of-the-world-on-abortion-rights">Oklahoma </a> are following suit in what she called model legislation, where states or countries model new laws off of existing ones to get them into effect faster.</p>
			<p>Mithani said that in order to make the countries in the WHO data easily comparable, the categories had to be carefully constructed and often broad. She said that if you look at the WHO data, it's actually completely different from what abortion access in the U.S. really looks like because it doesn’t account for the individual state laws that currently regulate abortion in America.</p>
			<p>“The law of the land does not necessarily dictate access,” Mithani said. “It's legal to get abortion up to like fetal viability or up to a certain gestational age, but many clinics don't offer them. So even though it might be legal, there's like a really big disconnect between what is actually possible to achieve.”</p>
